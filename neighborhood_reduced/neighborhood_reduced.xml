                <title>LA Times Neighborhood Boundaries within the City of Los Angeles</title>
                <othercit>The neighborhoods shown in this dataset are derived from a larger dataset drawn and maintained by the Data Desk, a team of Times reporters and Web developers in downtown L.A. The boundaries have expanded and shifted over time and now cover all of Los Angeles County broken down into 272 neighborhoods.

This version of the LA Times boundaries only includes neighborhoods fully or partially within the City of Los Angeles. Neighborhoods that extend into other cities have been clipped to only show the portion(s) of the neighborhoods that are within the City of Los Angeles.</othercit>
